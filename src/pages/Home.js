              Throughout the course of my career, I have perfected integrating
              technology into my teaching. I have also helped many students with
              my standardized testing proficiency. I am a capable and consistent
              problem-solver, skilled at prioritizing and managing projects with
              proficiency.

              In my previous role, I contributed to student development that led
              to successful admittance to the Governorâ€™s Honors Program. Now I
              am a web developer with a focus on education applications. Visit
              my portfolio to see previews of my projects. There, you can also
              find links to my contact information as well as my resume.
